Password Strength Checker is an interactive tool developed in Python using Jupyter Notebook that evaluates the strength of user-entered passwords based on key security criteria. It checks for minimum length, the presence of uppercase and lowercase letters, numerical digits, and special characters, then categorizes the password as weak, moderate, or strong. Designed for educational and practical use, the notebook provides clear, real-time feedback along with suggestions to help users improve weak passwords. This project demonstrates how Python can be used for basic security assessments and is ideal for beginners exploring string manipulation, regular expressions, and user input validation in a Jupyter environment. Open-source and customizable, it serves as a valuable learning tool for personal or academic use.
